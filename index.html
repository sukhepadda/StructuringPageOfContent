        <p class="introPara">Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
            Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book
            Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films,
            television shows, novels, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised
            by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane
            crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave
            him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn; romantic
            interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green
            Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, Spider-Man gets superhuman spider-powers and abilities from a bite
            from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces and ceilings, superhuman strength, speed, and
            agility, and detecting danger with his precognition ability called "spider-sense." He also builds
            wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial spider-webs of his own design that were meant to
            be used for fighting his enemies and web-swinging across the city. After his personal tragedy of his late
            Uncle Ben, Peter began using his spider-powers to fight against crime as Spider-Man. </p>
